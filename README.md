Operations Explained
Matrix Addition

Two matrices can be added only if they have the same dimensions.
Result: C[i][j] = A[i][j] + B[i][j]
Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is possible only when:
Columns of A = Rows of B

Result:
C[i][j] = Σ(A[i][k] * B[k][j])
Matrix Transpose

Rows become columns.
T[i][j] = A[j][i]Matrix Transpose
