# CodeAlpha_Matrix-Operation

CodeAlpha Internship - C Programming

Task 2 :- Matrix Operations

This project is a c program that performs Matrix Operations (Addition,Multiplication,transpose) by using 2d arrays

Arrays:Storing of data of same datatype is called Array

we will using 2d arrays

we will use for loops for this project

looping:iteration means repeation

Two matrices can be added only if they are only square matrix.

square matrix:the matrix which have same rows and columns

result:a[i][j]+b[i][j]

Two matrices can be multiplied only if the number of columns in the first matrix must equal the number of rows in the second matrix. 

 result[i][j] += m1[i][k] * m2[k][j];

 transpose of matrix is reversing rows and columns.

 transpose:a[j][i]
